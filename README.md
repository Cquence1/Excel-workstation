FUTURE TALE HOTEL RESERVATION ANALYSIS

Introduction:

The surge in online hotel reservation channels has revolutionised booking options, significantly influencing customer behavior. However, this convenience comes with challenges for hotels, particularly the impact of cancellations and no-shows on revenue.

Challenge:

The landscape of hotel reservations has been reshaped by online booking channels, influencing customer behavior significantly. A considerable portion of hotel reservations face disruptions through cancellations or no-shows, often stemming from reasons like altered plans and scheduling conflicts. The ease, and often affordability, of cancelling reservations is advantageous for guests but poses challenges for hotels, potentially diminishing revenue. The prevalent practise of offering free or low-cost cancellations adds to the complexity, requiring hotels to navigate a fine line between guest satisfaction and revenue optimisation.

Data cleaning:

- Identify and handle missing values using Excel functions
- Remove duplicates
- Address inconsistencies using Excel's find and replace
- Identify and handle outliers
