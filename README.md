FUTURE TALE HOTEL RESERVATION ANALYSIS

Introduction:

The surge in online hotel reservation channels has revolutionized booking options, significantly influencing customer behaviour. However, this convenience comes with challenges for hotels, particularly the impact of cancellations and no-shows on revenue.

Business Case:

The landscape of hotel reservations has been reshaped by online booking channels, influencing customer behavior significantly. A considerable portion of hotel reservations face disruptions through cancellations or no-shows, often stemming from reasons like altered plans and scheduling conflicts. The ease, and often affordability, of cancelling reservations is advantageous for guests but poses challenges for hotels, potentially diminishing revenue. The prevalent practice of offering free or low-cost cancellations adds to the complexity, requiring hotels to navigate a fine line between guest satisfaction and revenue optimisation.

Data cleaning:

- Identify and handle missing values
- Remove duplicates
- Address inconsistencies using Excel's find and replace
- Identify and handle outliers
- Group the lead time and age using the "IF function."

RECOMMENDATION:

Give attractive incentives for lead time falling in the range of short and within average to encourage customers to reduce cancellations due to lead time length. 
Reduce the average room price to encourage a large proportion of customers to retain their bookings.
Make the website a bit more friendly and easy to use, and place better incentive ads online, especially incentives for online bookings, to reduce cancellations.
Booking deposit non-refund should be relatively tangible to discourage customers from making last-minute cancellations.

CONCLUSION:
More information is needed on the demographic, geographic, psychographic, or behavioural characteristics of customers for deeper analysis to mitigate the cancellation rate.
