FUTURE TALE HOTEL RESERVATION ANALYSIS

Introduction:

The surge in online hotel reservation channels has revolutionised booking options, significantly influencing customer behavior. However, this convenience comes with challenges for hotels, particularly the impact of cancellations and no-shows on revenue.

Challenge:

The landscape of hotel reservations has been reshaped by online booking channels, influencing customer behavior significantly. A considerable portion of hotel reservations face disruptions through cancellations or no-shows, often stemming from reasons like altered plans and scheduling conflicts. The ease, and often affordability, of cancelling reservations is advantageous for guests but poses challenges for hotels, potentially diminishing revenue. The prevalent practice of offering free or low-cost cancellations adds to the complexity, requiring hotels to navigate a fine line between guest satisfaction and revenue optimisation.

Data cleaning:

- Identify and handle missing values using Excel functions
- Remove duplicates
- Address inconsistencies using Excel's find and replace
- Identify and handle outliers
- Group the lead time and age with the "IF function."

RECOMMENDATION:
Give attractive incentives for lead time falling in the range of short and within average to encourage customers to reduce cancellations due to lead time length. 
Reduce the average room price to encourage a large proportion of customers to retain their bookings.
Make the website a bit more friendly and easy to use, and place better incentive ads online, especially incentives for online bookings, to reduce cancellations.
Booking deposit non-refund should be relatively tangible to discourage customers from making last-minute cancellations.
